          <p>
            That's the beauty, cms driven does not restrict you. You can use the
            cms side by side with your custom pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can slowly migrate your existing pages to cms. Or start using
            the cms only for one small section of your websites like a blog or
            marketing pages.

        </div>
